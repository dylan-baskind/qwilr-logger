#QWILR LOGGER
A simeple logging utility for Node.js


## NARRATIVE LOGS

Qwilr Logger helps create "narrative" logs for asynchronous environments like Node.js. Narrative logs are those which make it easier to trace the execution path of our code. We use it every day at https://qwilr.com

## Installation
`$ npm install qwilr-logger --save`

## Usage

```javascript
// Require Qwilr Logger
var qwilrLogger = require("qwilr-logger");

// Instantiate a new logger, with the name 'Example Logger'
var log = qwilrLogger({name: "Example Logger"});

// Log Some Messages
log("Log something");
log.at("Main Controller");

// Log an Error
var crazyError = true;
if (crazyError){
  log.error("Just had a crazy error");
};
```

### NAMED LOGGERS

Qwilr Logger's are named because its useful to know where a particular log message originated from in the source code. Names are assigned when instantiating the logger.

```javascript
var loggerOne = qwilrLogger({ name: "Logger One" });
var loggerTwo = qwilrLogger({ name: "Logger Two" });
var loggerThree = qwilrLogger({ name: "Logger Three" });

loggerOne("Print this");
loggerTwo("Print that");
loggerOne.note("Note this");
loggerTwo.warn("Warn that");
loggerThree.success("This worked");
```

Outputs with:

### A RICHER VOCABULARY

Besides the standard log.error() log.warn(), when tracing the execution path of code, it can be instructive to log code markers i.e. being "at" a particular location in the codebase, or when a function is "doing" something etc.

Qwilr Logger includes the following logging functions:

`log.at()` used to describe when code is at the entry point of a module or controller function.
`log.at("Login Controller");`

`log.doing()` marks the beginning of an asynchronous block of code.

```javascript
log.doing("Requesting JSON");
someLongAsyncRequest().then(result, function() .... )
```

`log.note()` log a note about the code execution path.

```javascript
log.note("User password matched - good credentials");
```

`log.success()` marks the success of some block of code.

```javascript
doSomeDatabaseAction().then( function(err, result){
  if (result){
    log.success("Saved record to database");
  }
});
```

`log.warn()` marks a handled error - i.e. an error case that is handled, and non-critical

`log.warn("Sign up form got bad inputs - sending error data back to user");`

`log.error()` marks a serious error - something that signals a mistake in the code itself.

`log.error("Looks like the datacenter just blew up?");`

### ERROR HANDLER

If you use log.error() as recommended, for serious / exceptional errors only, then you'll probably want to take some further action besides just logging the error to console. i.e. send the error to an aggregation service (we use Sentry at Qwilr and love it). When instantiating your Qwilr Logger, you can pass an `errorHandler` option, which is a function that will be called with the error as an argument.

```javascript
// Attaching a custom error handler function
var otherLogger = qwilrLogger({
	name: "Another Logger",
	errorHandler: function(error) {
		// Do some error handling...
		// i.e. Send errors to an error aggregation service.
	};
});
```

### HELPER LOGGING FUNCTIONS

If in the options object you pass in a `onLog` function, this will be called on each log message.

The `onLog` function is called with the log verb, name and message arguments.
